## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Testing 

```sh
npm run test
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```sh
npm run build
```
